What is C# ? 
=> C# is a object oriented Programming language. (Java $ C# is almost same in syntax => Reason behind Anders Hejlaberg - 1996)

Year 2002 - C# 1.0 .Net Framework 1.0 Visual 2002
Year 2005 - C# 2.0 .Net Framework 2.0 Visual 2005
Year 2007 - C# 3.0 .Net Framework 3.5 Visual 2008
Year 2010 - C# 4.0 .Net Framework 4.0 Visual 2010
Year 2012 - C# 5.0 .Net Framework 4.5 Visual 2012
Year 2015 - C# 6.0 .Net Framework 4.6 Visual 2015
Year 2017-18 -C# 7.0 .Net Framework 4.7.1 Visual 2012

Year 2019 - C# 8.0 .Net core 3 ( First version to primarily target .Net core ) VS 2019
Year 2020 - C# 9.0 .Net 5 VS 2019
Year 2021 - C# 10.0 .Net 6 VS 2022
Year 2022 - C# 11.0 .Net 7 VS 2022
Year 2023 - C# 12.0 .Net 8 VS 2022
Year 2024 - C# 13.0 .Net 9 VS 2022
Year 2025 - C# 14.0 .Net 10 Visual Studio 2022 ( Preview)



=> .Net Framework (Windows based Application) Vs .Net core(Cross-Platform => mean Support on all os like => Windows, MacOs, Linux)  => Important Point of Interview.

=> C# release are categorized into two support parts => 
		LTS(Long Term Support ) Release => 
								1. LTS release supported duration for 3 years from their release date. 
								2. Even numbered .Net version are typically LTS releases (e.g: .NET6, .NET8)
		STS(Standard Term Support) 
								1. STS release are supported for 18 months from their release date. 
								2. Odd-numbered .NET version are typically LTS releases (e.g: .NET5, .NET7, .NET9)

=> Source Code 
=> Compiler => Source code to machine code coversion work. 
		CLR(Common language Runtime) => Source code => Machine Code => Process => 
				MSIL(Microsoft Intermediate Language)Or IL(Intermediate Language) (.exe, .dll)

=> .exe => It is Executable File. It contains Main method (Console Application - eg: Cmd).
=> .dll => Dynamic Link Library. It does not contains Main method.(Supportable file).

=> C# Sourc code => CLR - MSIL(.exe, .dll) - JIT(Just in time)=> Native(Machine) Code => OS => Run

=> Compile Time => C# source code => CLR - MSIL (.exe, .dll)
=> Run Time => JIT - Native (Machine ) Code - OS - Run

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Microsoft Journey : 

=> Console Application ( Best Template to learn C# ) => .exe=. 
=> Windows Application or Desktop Application (.ext ) => First UI Application
=> Web Application
=> Mobile Application
=> Web Api => Middle layer between web application or database. mobile application or database.
=> Game Application ......................... etc.

=> Reserve keyword can not be use for your own purpose.
Task 1 => 
		Create a example for Country and State with class name.

Task 2 => Take user two input for int (number ) and add them & substract them also
	for eg : num1 = 10 , num2 = 5 =>
			Add => num1 + num2 = 15
			Substract =>  num1 - num2 = 5

Debugging => Type 
	1. Step into (f11) => Debug inside a particular method.
	2. Step over (f10) => Line by line debugging 
	3. Step out (Shift + f11) => Out and continue the code without debugging.

	Applying Debugger 
	Disable Debugger 
	Delete Debugger 


=> Some notes 
	- NameSpace => It's a collection of namespace and types. Types like class, struct, enum, interface, delegate. 
	- Class => It is a container which contain the data member. Data member like field, property, Methods.
	- Main Method => This is a member of a class and this is entry point. It means when you will run your 
		application so this method will be execute first. 
	- Static => It is a modifier. 
	- Void => It means will not return anything. 


	=================================================================================================
						20/09/2025: 

	Variable => It is a container which holds the value. And Value depends on the data type.
	Data Type => It is define the type of data. 

	Naming Convention Rule => 
	PascalCase : NameSpace, Class, Struct, Enum, Delegate, Interface.. ect.
	camelCase : field, local varialbe, variable, parameterized... etc.


	==================================================================================================

					22/10/2025 : 
	- Static member will be access by the class Name & and without class name also. 
	- Non-static member will be acess by a obj Name.

	Static Members :- field, Property, Method - If static modifier is used it means it is static member.  
	Non-Static Members :- field, Property, Method - If satic modifier is not used it means it is non static member.

	Static Members :- You can access static member with the class name. 
	Non Static Members :- You can access non-static member with the object name.


	==================================================================================================
					24/09/2025 :

	Data Type: 

	     Data Type Category
         Pre-Define or System-Define Data Type
         int, double, char, string, bool, object, etc..

         User-Define Data Type
         class, object, array, interface, delegate, enum, struct, etc..

         Based on the memory allocation in C# Data type are two types which are follow as :

         Value Type
         int, double, char, bool, struc, enum, etc..
         Default value is 0. 
         It stores value on stack memory.
         No Garbase Collector required for memeory management.


         Reference Type
         string, object, class, array, interface, delegate, etc..
         Default value is null.
         It stores value on Heap memory but reference on stack memeory.
         Garbase Collector is required for memeory management.

		 // String Vs StringBuilder 

        // String class is defined inside the System namespace.
        // StringBuilder class is defined inside the System.Text namespace.

        // The string class is Immutable. It means whenever you will create the instace then you can't change it. when will 
        // change the value then it will store the value of the same ref but different memory location.
        // Stringbuilder is Mutable. It means if you change the value then it will add the value to an existing memory location.

        // The string is slower compared to StringBuilder.
        // StringBuilder is faster than String.

        // string requires more memory allocation. If you will change value constinously. 
        // Because it will create the new instance for every change.
        // StringBuilder requires less memory if you will change value constinously because it will update the value on the same 
        // memeory location.

        // Use String when : 
        // You are performing few or no modifications to the string(like appeding, inserting, or deleting).
        // You are working with short strings. 

        // Use StringBuilder when :
        // You are performing many modifications to the string (eg: in loops).
        // You need better performance and memory efficiency especially with large repeated string operations.

		Note: 
		1. Inside static class only static member will be allowed ( for eg: Field, Property, Method)
		2. Inside non-static class you can create static as well as non static member (for eg: Field,
		   Property, Method.)
